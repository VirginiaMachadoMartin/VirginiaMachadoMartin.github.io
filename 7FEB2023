#FIRST TASK
# declare a variable, check where it sits in memory (hex-id)
# 
# look at the following objects
#zero = 0
#a = [zero]
#b = [zero]
#c = a[:]
#a2 = a

# first check the hex ids for the first elements of each list, then check the ids for the lists themselves
#print(hex(id(zero)), hex(id(a)), hex(id(b)), hex(id(c)), hex(id(a2)))

#if a == a2:
    #print("TRUE")





#NEXT TASK
## to run in your console: 
## $ python3 myscript.py my_first_arg my_second_arg

#import sys


#def main():
#print("HERE IS", sys.argv)
  #print("Hello " + sys.argv[1] + "!")

 # print("The system type is" , type(sys.argv))
#main()



#NEXT TASK
def my_func(): # note the naming convention
  a = 2     # belongs to my_func
  b = 4     # ...
  c = a + b # ...
  print(c)  # ...
  return(c) # belongs to my_func

# nothing so far has happened, becuase we need to call my_func(); let us verify this, by doing something else first:
print("nothing has happened up to here")






#TASK2: 
##read in the file

#count the character
#def count_char(input_string):
    #I can write pass here if I want to not have # in fron ot def
